# ohmyvps: Preconfigured Hardended GNU/Linux for VPS
- currently `x86_64` is the only supported
- `nginx` runs completely rootless
- firewall disallows all incoming connections, besides `ssh`, `http` and `https` by default
- `ssh`
    - default `sshd` configuration disallows password authentication
    - manual `ssh` port by default
    - allow-list for incoming `ssh` connections
        - alternatively, firewall autobans those who failed to login
- designed for `tmux` + `vim` users.
